================================================================

The following changes were made and were included with the 
January 2016 monthly update of the Compulife Quotation System:

12.  United Home/Farm Life - product changes

December 17th - Compulife has now added the juvenile
and preferred rates for the company's Provider 
Simplified Issue products.  

We have also corrected the products and change
them to age last.  Some were quoting age nearest.


11.  Sagicor Life - no lapse UL - SI

December 16th - Sagicor Life has asked that we 
identify their no lapse UL products, for issue
ages up to 65, for face amounts of $400,000 or 
less, as SI (Simplified Issue).  That change 
is in this update.

rates for its Opterm 10, 15, 20 and 30 products.

8.  Newest Windows Program - bugs fixed

December 14th - This newest version of the Windows 
includes some fixes for the Canadian versio of our
software.  Both countrie use the same program, the
data files are different.


7.  American General Life - new product/rates

December 8th (2) - On December 4th American 
General introduced a new no lapse UL product 
called Secure Lifetime GUL III which will be 
replacing their GUL II.  The company only 
provided us with the rates earlier today, and
so we have been working very hard all afternoon
and evening to get these to you ASAP.

The GUL II will remain available until 
sometime in February.


6.  Newest Windows Program - bugs fixed

December 8th - The Windows program that we released
on December 4th turned up a bug, and so we re-issued
the old version very quickly thereafter.  

The bug has been fixed.

You can read more about this updated Windows 
program in item number 4 below.


5.  Stonebridge Life - company removed

December 8th - All business previously done by 
Stonebridge Life is now being done under 
Transamerica Premier.

Thanks to the subscriber who brought that to
our attention, and a 10% coupon has been given.


4.  Newest Windows Program

December 4th - This version of the Windows program
fixes some minor listing bugs, and an indexing bug
that was still writing index information to the 
COMP.D0? files.  This meant nothing to the vast
majority of users, but would have affected those 
customers using the Internet Engine.

A new internet engine was shipped earlier in the 
week, and that engine, if updated to a customer's
server, will be compatible with the changes made
to the GOWIN.EXE program.

The engines have all been updated on our own servers
so if you are using the Compulife web quote option,
you do not need to do anything.


3.  Pruco Life - ROP correction

December 4th - We realized that the error we had
with the ROP calculation was coming from an error
in the ROP factor table, caused by an error in the 
ROP factor data entry system.  Bugs of this nature
need to be tracked down carefully, but we have now
found and fixed the problem.

To ensure that it did not affect ANY other Pru ROP
products and face amounts, we have manually re-entered
all the factors and believe the problem is resolved.


2.  Securian Life - new rates

December 1st - The new rates for Minnesota Life
have now been approved in NY for Securian Life.


1.  Pruco Life - ROP premium error

December 1st - An error was found for the ROP
premiums for Pruco Life's 15 year version.  The
issue has to do with Female Preferred Plus rates, 
and we are currently tracking it down as a bug
with our ROP data entry system.  We have temporarily
turned off the product until we get it resolved.
